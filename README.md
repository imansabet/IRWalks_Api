# IRWalks
# Detailed Project Description
# IRWalks.API

Entity Framework Core (EF Core):

Data Modeling: The API uses EF Core to model the domain entities. These entities represent the core components of the IRWalks application, such as Walks, Users, Regions, etc.
Database Context: A DbContext class is used to interact with the database. It configures entity relationships, sets up database tables, and handles migrations.
Migrations: EF Core migrations are used to evolve the database schema over time. The project likely includes migration files that manage changes to the database structure without losing data.
ASP.NET Core Identity:

Authentication and Authorization: Identity is integrated for managing user authentication (login, registration) and authorization (role-based access control). Users are assigned roles, and claims are used to grant or restrict access to specific API endpoints.
Token-Based Authentication: Likely uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication across the API. Tokens are issued on successful login and used to authenticate subsequent API requests.
Repository Pattern:

Abstraction of Data Access: The project may implement the Repository pattern to abstract data access logic. This allows for easier testing and separation of concerns.
Unit of Work: A Unit of Work pattern might be used to group multiple operations that need to be committed together, ensuring transactional consistency.
Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination:

Filtering: Implemented to allow users to filter data based on specific criteria. For example, users might filter walks by region, difficulty, or date.
Sorting: Allows data to be sorted by various fields, such as name, date, or duration.
Pagination: Essential for managing large datasets, pagination ensures that only a subset of data is returned per request, reducing load times and improving performance. The API might use a common pattern like Skip and Take in LINQ queries.
Swagger Documentation:

Interactive API Documentation: Swagger is integrated for API documentation, providing an interactive UI to test endpoints. This is particularly useful for developers consuming the API.
Middleware:

Exception Handling: Custom middleware may be used for centralized exception handling, ensuring that errors are logged and appropriate HTTP responses are returned.
Request Logging: Middleware might be in place to log incoming requests for monitoring and debugging purposes.
Security:

Data Protection: Measures like data encryption (e.g., using ASP.NET Core Data Protection) and HTTPS enforcement are likely implemented to secure sensitive information.
CSRF Protection: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is essential for securing the API against unauthorized actions performed by authenticated users.

# IRWalks.UI

Frontend Framework:

Bootstrap: Likely used for responsive design, ensuring the UI works well on different devices.
JavaScript Frameworks: The frontend might use libraries like jQuery for DOM manipulation or more modern frameworks like React or Angular for a dynamic, single-page application experience.
API Consumption:

AJAX Requests: The UI makes asynchronous requests to the API using AJAX to fetch and display data without requiring full page reloads.
Token Management: The UI handles authentication tokens, storing them securely (e.g., in local storage) and attaching them to API requests for authenticated actions.
Client-Side Validation:

Form Validation: Client-side validation is likely implemented to ensure user input is correct before sending it to the API. This might involve custom JavaScript or HTML5 validation attributes.
